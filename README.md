This is a quick professional startup project in Laravel framework. 
It helps dev who lack most of time a quick base project containing users modules, roles and permission modules and adminLtd theme at the same time. 
It will help also everyone who need laravel prject with the authentication done.
I used Roman Bincan package for role and permission, JWT(Json Web Token) package for those who want authentication that use token not session and admin Lte theme for the interface.
After cloning the project, do composer update for installing those package.
